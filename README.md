# Q-Learning-Path-Finding-Agent

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The goal of this game was to have the pirate (agent) find its way through the maze and find the treasure.
A Q-Learning Algorithm was used with this neural network in order to create a reinforced learning policy
as it weaved its way through the mine infested maze. Using a 1/10th Epsilon Greedy Policy, where the agent
had a 1/10th chance to explore the maze and increase its knowledge base, and every other choice it would
exploit its knowledge base and try to maximize its reward in reaching the goal.

I created the Q-Learning algorithm portion of this code, while the rest (as well as pseudocode for the Q-Learning Algorithm)
was provided by the professor: Dr. Obafemi Balogun, MS, MS, Ph.D.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

This course, CS 370: "Current and Emerging Trends in Computer Science", shows what has not only become popular
in computer science recently, but what has in some ways been apart of it for a while. AI and ML has its roots in
computer science as early as 1941 when Alan Turing created his machine to decode Enigma, and then later in 1950 when he made the turing test. 
AI and ML has been used accrossed several fields of computer science, from game development where users play against the AI computer,
to data science where ML is used to interpret the large pool of data and make predictions, face recognition and image classifiers, defects detections in factories, ect.
There is a continual need for AI and ML as it is an ever expanding field and has the ability to evolve and change the landscape of computer science
and every other field as it is used to help solve problems, automate tedious or dangerous tasks, increase production and productivity, and analyze 
data to help make informed decisions.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

A computer scientist has a wide range of job responsibilities. They must gather requirements and specs from their customer, create a prelimanary design and often create a prototype to present to the customer for approval. Then they create a road map and set a timetable to fully research, develop, test, polish, and ship the product out for production. In all of this, they have to consider the user when creating the product as well as those who would later become mainters of this code. They must think logically about each process, and must code securely to prevent the application from failing or breaking because it had not been properly tested and maintained.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My Ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization is to make sure that I produce secure software applications that have
been reviewed and undergone testing so that any vulnerabilities are mitigated when possible. That I am transparent with how our model
trains as much as it is legal and within my right to do so, and that I do all I can to prevent and avoid bias in training as much as it is possible. I must also ensure that mysoftware is maintaimanle, flexible, readable and aligned with the organizations fundamental foundations and rules and that
I deliver a product that provides value to the organization.
